A couple simple image processing filters. Takes an image and creates a Guassian blur, grayscale, and radial Sobel
edge detection output image.

The Guassian blur implementation is perfectly accurate but very slow, be warned.

This project was built to understand how a kernal matrix interacts with an image. Hopefully this will be used later
for an attempt at a simple number recognition program, using a neural network.
